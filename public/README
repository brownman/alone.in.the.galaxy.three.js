         Long time not doing a "proper" demo...
         I have always found unfair that browser
         demos had to be put in a special category or
         mixed with other works that weren't even
         realtime.

         However, this year, Euskal was including
         browser demos in the main demo competition.
         So I was somehow forced to contribute :)

         On top of that, I've been slowly working on
         a 3d engine and a sequencer for the past few
         months and they seemed advanced enough to
         give it a try.

         But, of course, I wasn't able to start
         before it was already one day before the
         deadline. Yesterday night I was struggling
         about what the demo should be about. In the
         end, I decided to just start coding whatever
         and improvise. I started around midnight and
         I'm considering it done 12 hours later :O

         It's all software rendering (no WebGL),
         so don't expect much performance. It's
         running at 20-30fps on my Mac Mini Core 2
         Duo @ 2.53Ghz with Ubuntu/Linux. If you are
         running MacOS. I'm sorry to say that it
         won't run faster than 1fps... For some
         reason Chrome team decided to use
         CoreGraphics instead of Skia.

         This version doesn't have any loading stuff,
         but I guess, eventually, I'll end up
         implementing it... while I'm at it I'll
         probably do a WebGL version too :)

         Requirements:

            For better results (at this point)
            Chrome Windows/Linux.

         Software used:

             Ubuntu, Gedit, Chrome, Gimp, Blender
