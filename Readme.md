# A Tribute to the King's Gambit: Keep the Flame Burning

In essence, this is the [jChess](https://github.com/bmarini/jchess) code of [Ben Marini](https://github.com/bmarini/game-of-the-day/) 
tweaked by adding the xboard/eboard chess set which I recreated from [eboard](http://www.bergo.eng.br/eboard) 
by adjusting the alpha channels of the pgn images. This has been done with a nice C++ library called [FreeImage](http://freeimage.sourceforge.net).

A working demo of this code can be found at [http://c33.heroku.com/](http://c33.heroku.com/).
